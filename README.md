# Kenna


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'kenna'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kenna

## Usage

Get an Api Instance

Test token ty9hxcpmgdrvnuqe
@api = Kenna::Api.new("your_token")

Test token ty9hxcpmgdrvnuqe
@api = Kenna::Api.new("ty9hxcpmgdrvnuqe")

There are basic crud methods that return a Response Object, 
    use .body to get the JSON 
    use .code to get the response code
    use .headers to get the headers
    'resource' is the root name of the endpoint, such as 'users'
TODO: Several methods are responding only with body and need to be refactored
TODO: Address throttling issues

@api.post(uri, body)
@api.postByResource(resource, body)
@api.get(uri)
@api.getById(resource, id)
@api.update(uri, body)
@api.updateById(resource, id, body)
@api.delete(uri)
@api.deleteById(resource, id)

The following are two examples of shortcut methods,
I intend to provide these for all routes

Get All Users (only up to 500 for now)
@users = @api.getAllUsers()
puts @users

Getting the first User ID (there should always be at least one)
@user_id = @users[0]['id']

Get A Single User by ID
@user = @api.getUserById(@user_id)
puts @user

## Development
